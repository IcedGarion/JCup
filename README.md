**Uniupo university, Science & Technologic Innovation dept., Language&Translators Lab course Project**

This repository is about a simple example of JCUP and JFLEX using. In this example, a simple new programming language is defined (only declarations, assignments and prints) and then parsed, translated into JAVA and then executed.

The language sintax is like the following:

LET i=10;

34+i;

LET j=i+5;

j+i;

(Where 'LET' precedes a declaration and the other instructions are operations and prints). For every line of code a message is printed: it contains the result of the line operation, which is parsed, translated and executed via JAVA instructions (like a simple sum)
